# 🌫 Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction & Classification using Random Forest

This project analyzes and predicts Air Quality Index (AQI) levels using machine learning techniques on real-world environmental data. It includes both regression (for predicting AQI values) and classification (categorizing AQI into quality levels like low, medium, high).
